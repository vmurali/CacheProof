Others claims:
  - Hierarchical scales in terms of IPC better than non-hierarchical
  - Hierarchical is harder to verify

Contributions:
  - Formal verification of hierarchical inclusive protocol family
  - Most if not all hierarchical inclusive protocols can be reduced to these axioms - easy verification

Demonstrate:
  - How to verify
    * MSI
    * MESI
    * CacheIntervetion MESI
    * MOESI
  - Verification effort scales unlike SMT/Model checking
    * Constant time for any number of cores - demostrate graph against SMT
  - Performance numbers for each verified protocol compared
  - Performance numbers for hierarchical protocol compared against non-hierarchical
