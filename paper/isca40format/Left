The MSI-template implements coherence (because of single-writer and last-reader) provided that dir is conservative, and all methods return.

MSI + scheduler obeys the local properties except ordering (blocking also covered).

local properties guarantee invariants (conservative + deadlock free)

so MSI + scheduler implements cache coherence.
