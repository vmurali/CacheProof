\section{Refinements}

In this section we discuss important design changes that would of
interest to implementors. Most of these require no change at all to
our framework only a change in how the local properties are proven.
We have formally proven the correctness of each of these choices, but
due to space concerns we will not discuss them in their full detail. 

\subsection{Buffer Sizing}

This is trivial as nowhere in the proof have we relied on the size of the buffer

\subsection{Partial Caching}

This is how we can model the full memory with a smaller cache and some tags with the missing addresses being assumed to be \In. 

Proof requires the partial view is sound in comparison to flat model
when static. Showing upgrades/ downgrades are okay, requires that
overflow looks like a voluntary rule .

\subsection{Pair-wise Communication Channels}

In industrial grade implementations, these channels are generally
implemented logically over an interconnect network which requires
additional verification to show deadlock avoidance and starvation
freedom.  This introduces additional verification requirements to
avoid deadlock and starvation. Though we have proved these results for
a general interconnect network as opposed to a point-to-point
connection between caches, we omit the formal discussion of deadlock
and starvation freedom in this paper because of lack of space. We will
informally discuss how deadlock and starvation freedom properties are
proved for our system.

* Actually making each cache structure a cache not a perfect copy
* Adding delays / buffering

\subsection{Communication Fabric}

Requires we prove the communication channel can always move
messages. Trivial in p2p setting, but for grids requires some
nontrivial understanding of routing protocol.
